History of Georgia Southern Football

Georgia Southern University football has a storied history that dates back to 1982 when the modern program was established. The Eagles quickly rose to prominence in the Football Championship Subdivision (FCS), winning their first national championship in 1985 under head coach Erk Russell, who is often credited with building the program's foundation. Georgia Southern continued its success in the FCS, capturing six national titles by 2000, with notable coaches like Tim Stowers (1990 - 1995) and Paul Johnson (1997 - 2001), the latter of whom implemented the effective triple-option offense that became a hallmark of the program.
In 2014, Georgia Southern transitioned to the Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) and joined the Sun Belt Conference, marking a new chapter in its football history. The Eagles had immediate success, finishing their inaugural FBS season with a 9-3 record under head coach Willie Fritz. However, Fritz left for Tulane after one season, and the program subsequently hired Tyson Summers. After a challenging stint, the program saw improvement under head coach Chad Lunsford, who took the helm in 2017 and led the Eagles to multiple bowl appearances, including a victory in the 2018 Camellia Bowl. As of recent years, Georgia Southern continues to build on its legacy, striving for success in the competitive landscape of college football.
