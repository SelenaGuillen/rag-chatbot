History of Georgia Tech Football
Georgia Institute of Technology, commonly known as Georgia Tech, has a rich football history that dates back to 1892. The Yellow Jackets have been a significant force in college football, winning four national championships (in 1917, 1928, 1952, and 1990) and producing numerous All-Americans and NFL players. The program gained prominence under legendary head coach John Heisman, who coached from 1904 to 1919 and is credited with establishing many of the modern football strategies still in use today.
Throughout the years, Georgia Tech has transitioned through various conferences, originally competing in the Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Association (SIAA) before moving to the Southern Conference (SoCon) in 1921 and later becoming a founding member of the Southeastern Conference (SEC) in 1933. After a dispute over scholarship limits, Georgia Tech left the SEC in 1963 to become an independent. Georgia Tech Football joined the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) in 1983, where it is currently a member. Under coaches like Bobby Dodd, who led the team from 1945 to 1966 and remains one of the most celebrated figures in the program's history, the Yellow Jackets became known for their strong running game and disciplined play.
In more recent years, Paul Johnson took over as head coach in 2008, implementing a successful option offense that led the team to several bowl games and an ACC championship in 2014. After Johnson's departure in 2018, the program underwent a coaching change with the hiring of Geoff Collins, who aimed to modernize the offense and rebuild the team. As of now, Georgia Tech continues to strive for success in the competitive landscape of college football, maintaining a storied legacy while adapting to new challenges.
