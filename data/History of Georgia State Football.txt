Georgia State Football History

Georgia State University football began in 2010, initially competing as a member of the Football Championship Subdivision (FCS) in the Colonial Athletic Association (CAA). The program's inaugural head coach, Bill Curry, led the team for its first three seasons but faced challenges in establishing a competitive program. In 2013, Curry stepped down, and Trent Miles took over, guiding the Panthers through their transition to the Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) in the same year, joining the Sun Belt Conference. In 2017 they had a notable victory over Appalachian State.
In 2019, the university hired Shawn Elliott as head coach. Elliott, a former offensive line coach at South Carolina, brought a renewed focus on building a strong program and cultivating talent. During his tenure, the Panthers achieved several milestones, including their first bowl appearance in 2019. Georgia State's football program has continued to evolve, adapting to the competitive landscape of college football while striving for success both on and off the field. The Panthers have developed a growing fan base and continue to build a legacy within college athletics.
