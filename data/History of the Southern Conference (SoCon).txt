History of the Southern Conference (SoCon)
The Southern Conference (SoCon) was established on February 25, 1921, in Atlanta when fourteen institutions separated from the Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Association. The charter members included Alabama, Auburn, Clemson, Georgia, Georgia Tech, Kentucky, Maryland, Mississippi State, North Carolina, North Carolina State, Tennessee, Virginia, Virginia Tech, and Washington & Lee. In 1922, six additional universities joined: Florida, LSU, Mississippi, South Carolina, Tulane, and Vanderbilt. Other early additions included Sewanee (1924), Virginia Military Institute (1924), and Duke (1929).
The SoCon played a significant role in the formation of two major conferences. In 1932, thirteen schools (Alabama, Auburn, Florida, Georgia, Georgia Tech, Kentucky, LSU, Mississippi, Mississippi State, University of the South (Sewanee), Tennessee, Tulane, and Vanderbilt), primarily from the South and West of the Appalachians, left to create the Southeastern Conference (SEC). In 1953, seven schools (Clemson, Duke, Maryland, North Carolina, North Carolina State, South Carolina, and Wake Forest) departed to form the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC). Following these departures, the SoCon's status diminished, and it dropped to Division I-AA (FCS) in 1982.
The SoCon is also notable for hosting the first postseason basketball tournament to determine a conference champion, which began in 1921 and became "official" in 1922. The inaugural tournament was held at the Municipal Auditorium in Atlanta, with North Carolina defeating non-member Mercer in the finals. The SoCon Basketball Tournament remains the oldest conference tournament in the nation.
