History of the Conference USA (CUSA)
Conference USA (CUSA), founded in 1995 through the merger of the Metro Conference and Great Midwest Conference, began as a broad league spanning from Florida to Missouri, Texas to Wisconsin. Initially, the conference did not include certain member schools like Dayton, VCU, and Virginia Tech but invited Houston to maintain balance after the Southwest Conference dissolved. CUSA launched competition in all sports, excluding football, which commenced in 1996.
The 2005–06 academic year brought significant upheaval, with five members departing for the Big East, including football schools Cincinnati, Louisville, and South Florida, alongside Charlotte and Saint Louis moving to the Atlantic 10. In response, CUSA expanded by adding UCF and Marshall from the MAC, along with Rice, SMU, Tulsa, and later UTEP from the WAC, resulting in a twelve-member league that sponsored football.
Further realignment in 2013 saw the departure of Houston, Memphis, SMU, and UCF to the American Athletic Conference, following shifts within the Big East. CUSA invited five new members—UTSA, Louisiana Tech, North Texas, FIU, and Old Dominion—to replenish its ranks. The conference faced another wave of changes in 2014 when Tulane and East Carolina left for the new American Athletic Conference, prompting the addition of Middle Tennessee, Florida Atlantic, and Western Kentucky from the Sun Belt.
In 2021, CUSA prepared for another transformation, losing Charlotte, Florida Atlantic, North Texas, Rice, UAB, and UTSA to the American Athletic Conference, and Southern Miss, Marshall, and Old Dominion to the Sun Belt. To address these losses, CUSA welcomed Liberty, Jacksonville State, New Mexico State, and Sam Houston in 2023. The league also introduced beach volleyball and bowling, marking an expansion into new sports. As of late 2023, Delaware and Missouri State were set to join in the 2025–26 season, solidifying CUSA's evolving membership landscape.
