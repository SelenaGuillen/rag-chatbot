Kennesaw State University football was established in 2013, making it one of the newest programs in college football. The Owls began play in the Football Championship Subdivision (FCS) and quickly made an impact, winning their first-ever game in 2015 under head coach Brian Bohannon. Bohannon, a former assistant at Georgia Tech, implemented a triple-option offense that emphasized a strong running game, which proved successful as the team finished with a 7-4 record in its inaugural season.
In 2017, Kennesaw State achieved its first FCS playoff appearance, marking a significant milestone for the program. The Owls continued to build on their success, winning the Big South Conference championship in 2018 and earning a spot in the FCS playoffs again. In 2024, KSU finalized its move to the Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) and joined Conference USA. Under Bohannon's leadership, Kennesaw State football has established itself as a competitive program with a growing fan base, and the transition to FBS represents an exciting new chapter in the team's history.
