History of the Southeastern Conference (SEC)
The Southeastern Conference (SEC) was established on December 8 and 9, 1932, in Knoxville, Tennessee, when thirteen members of the Southern Conference left to form their own league. Ten of the original members have remained in the SEC since its inception: the University of Alabama, Auburn University, the University of Florida, the University of Georgia, the University of Kentucky, Louisiana State University (LSU), the University of Mississippi (Ole Miss), Mississippi State University, the University of Tennessee, and Vanderbilt University. The three founding members that left the conference are Sewanee, which departed after the 1940 season to become a Division III independent; Georgia Tech, which left after the 1963 season; and Tulane, which exited after the 1965 season.
In 1990, the SEC expanded from ten to twelve teams with the addition of the Arkansas Razorbacks and the South Carolina Gamecocks, both beginning competition in the 1991â€“1992 season. This expansion also led to the creation of two divisions, with the Western Division consisting of Central Time Zone schools and the Eastern Division including Eastern Time Zone schools plus Vanderbilt. The SEC became the first conference to receive NCAA approval for an annual football championship game in 1992, initially held in Birmingham before moving to Atlanta.
The SEC expanded again in 2012, adding Texas A&M University and the University of Missouri, both of which left the Big 12 Conference to join. In July 2021, Oklahoma and Texas expressed their intent to join the SEC, and by February 2023, they reached a buyout agreement to enter the conference in 2024, marking another significant shift in the SEC's membership landscape.
