Paul Johnson, who kept the triple option relevant in Power Five football, is retiring after 11 seasons at Georgia Tech.

Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets head coach Paul Johnson, 61, a three-time ACC coach of the year and Georgia Tech's winningest coach in more than five decades, has been contemplating retirement for several weeks. Georgia Tech was 7-5 this season.

“After 40 years of coaching, it’s time to take a break,” Johnson said in a statement. “My family has sacrificed a lot over the years. I want to watch my daughter [Kaitlyn, a professional opera singer] perform and do some things with my wife [Susan] that we’ve never had a chance to do. It’s been a great run for the last 11 years here on The Flats. I’m proud of what we’ve accomplished and am looking forward to having the chance to coach this team one last time at our bowl game next month.”

Johnson went 82-59 at Georgia Tech, winning an ACC title in 2009. Perhaps his greatest achievement came in 2014 when he led the Yellow Jackets to 11-3 and No. 7 national ranking with a win in the Orange Bowl.

He went 189-98 as a college coach, most notably turning Navy into a perennial winner and winning a pair of Division I-AA national titles at Georgia Southern where he was coach from 1997 - 2001.
