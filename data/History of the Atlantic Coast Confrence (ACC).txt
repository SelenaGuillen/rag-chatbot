History of the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC)

The Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) was established on June 14, 1953, when seven universities—Clemson, Duke, Maryland, North Carolina, North Carolina State, South Carolina, and Wake Forest—left the Southern Conference. Virginia was added as the eighth member on December 4, 1953.

In 1971, South Carolina departed to become an independent. The ACC expanded for the first time in 1979 with the addition of Georgia Tech from the Metro Conference, although Georgia Tech football joined the ACC in 1983. Florida State joined in 1991, marking the conference's first significant expansion since its founding.

During the 2004-2005 realignment, the ACC added Miami and Virginia Tech on July 1, 2004, and Boston College on July 1, 2005, after initially targeting other Big East schools.

In 2011, Syracuse and Pittsburgh announced their intention to join the ACC, officially entering on July 1, 2013. Notre Dame agreed to join in all sports except football and men's ice hockey on September 12, 2012, and became a partial member on July 1, 2013. Maryland's Board of Regents voted to leave for the Big Ten in 2014, and Louisville joined the ACC as a full member to replace Maryland on July 1, 2014.

In April 2013, all 15 member schools signed a grant of media rights, which was extended in July 2016. The ACC formed an alliance with the Big Ten and Pac-12 in August 2021.

On September 1, 2023, the ACC announced it would add California, SMU, and Stanford, with SMU joining on July 1, 2024, and Cal and Stanford on August 2, 2024.
