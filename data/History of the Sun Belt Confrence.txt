History of the Sun Belt Conference
The Sun Belt Conference was founded on August 4, 1976, with the University of New Orleans, South Alabama, Georgia State, Jacksonville University, UNC Charlotte, and South Florida. It later added Western Kentucky, Old Dominion, UAB, and Virginia Commonwealth. New Orleans left in 1980 due to facility issues and rejoined the American South Conference in 1987.
After the 1990–91 season, most members left for other conferences, leaving only Western Kentucky, South Alabama, and Jacksonville. The Sun Belt merged with the American South Conference in 1991, including Arkansas State, Louisiana Tech, Southwestern Louisiana (now ULL), Texas–Pan American (now UTRGV), New Orleans (rejoined), Lamar, and UCF. The conference began sponsoring football in 2001 with New Mexico State, North Texas, and Middle Tennessee State joining as full members, along with Louisiana at Monroe and Idaho as football-only members.
In 2004, Troy joined for all sports, followed by Florida Atlantic in 2005. Western Kentucky joined the football conference in 2009. In the early 2010s, Georgia State returned in 2013, and Texas State joined, while FIU, North Texas, Florida Atlantic, and Middle Tennessee moved to Conference USA in 2013. Appalachian State, Georgia Southern, Idaho, and New Mexico State joined in 2014.
From 2021 to 2023, the Sun Belt added Southern Miss, Marshall, Old Dominion, and James Madison. Little Rock and UT Arlington departed in 2023. The conference also reinstated men's soccer and added beach volleyball and women's swimming and diving.
